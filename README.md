## Project Idea

VacayCalendar is a collaborative planning application inspired by the convenience of Google Calendar but tailored for vacation plans. It allows users to create and manage their vacation itineraries, collaborate with friends, and organize events. With real-time updates and notifications, users can stay connected and informed about their own and friendsâ€™ vacation plans.

## Technologies

The application is based on:

- Language: TypeScript
- Frontend framework: Next.js with React
- Backend/Database/Authentification: Firebase

## Functionalities

- User Authentication: Users can register and log in to an account.
- Calendar: Users can create calendars for personal use and public calendars that are visible to added friends.
- Event Management: Users can add, edit, and delete events on their calendars. There is also a specialized function for adding vacation dates.
- Notifications: Users can receive notifications for events and changes made on their calendar.
